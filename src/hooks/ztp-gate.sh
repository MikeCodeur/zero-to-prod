# ztp-gate — zero-to-prod repo-level guardrails, enforced by git (tool-independent).
# Works the same whether the harness is Claude Code or Codex:
# the gates live in the repo, not in a tool's per-command permissions.
#
# Subcommands:
#   ztp-gate plan-validated <id>     exit 0 if docs/plans/<id>.md has `validated: yes`
#   ztp-gate ship-allowed  <id>      exit 0 if docs/reviews/<id>.md has `Ship allowed: yes`
#   ztp-gate verif-current <id>      exit 0 if docs/verif/<id>.md proves the CURRENT code was verified
#   ztp-gate pre-commit              block a code commit on feature/<id> without a validated plan
#
# There is no push-time gate: /ztp-ship squash-merges, so a merged story leaves no merge
# commit to detect client-side. Enforce `ztp-gate ship-allowed <id>` in CI / branch protection.
